# SafeTravels

SafeTravels visualizes local bus and bikeways in Houston as well as local crime data to help you navigate through the city safely.

From the Map Menu you can visualize Houston crime data as a heatmap or as individual markers that, when clicked, provide detailed information for particular crimes. The Map Menu also allows you to visualize bus and bike route information in order determine the safest route.

Finally, from the Map, click the "Get WalkScore" button to see the walk, bike, and transit score for your location, in addition to nearby amenities, such as restaurants, entertainment, and groceries.

Currently, SafeTravels only supports data for Houston, Texas, but we are working to include more cities soon.
